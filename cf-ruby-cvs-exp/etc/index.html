<p>Ruby-CVS-exp (<a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-cvs-exp/">project page</a>, <a href="http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78">download</a>) is a Ruby wrapper around Sitaram Iyer's excellent little <a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/code/cvs-exp/">cvs-exp.pl</a> utility.  

<p>Ruby-CVS-exp makes is possible to convert the output of cvs-exp to HTML (screenshot is below).  This is handy for displaying recent commits to a project, as you can see by clicking on one of the "Recent" links <a href="https://ultraforge.ultralog.net">here</a>.

<p>Very generally, you can put CVSHistory.rb in your cgi-bin directory and then use a little CGI script like <a href="http://cougaar.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cf-ruby-cvs-exp/src/?cvsroot=cf-ruby-cvs-exp">history.cgi</a> to interface with it.  Note that this CGI script expects three parameters - the cvs root, the module directory name, and the branch name.  There's also an optional "days" parameter which tells it how many days of history to display.
